# This only works with Windows, and by no means am I trying to copy Among Us, I'm just trying to make my own take on the game! :D

# This is only FOR FUN, and in no way am I trying to profit off of Innersloth's game.

How to run the game: 
1. Download the exe from [here](https://github.com/planecarplanecar/among-us-with-command-prompt/releases/tag/v0.01-alpha)
2. Open the exe
3. If Windows detects it as virus, it's not- just click see more and click run away
4. It should have opened up a command prompt, and you can start playing! :D

With that said, time to get to the updates.
